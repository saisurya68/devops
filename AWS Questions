Basic Cloud Concepts

1. What is cloud computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics over the internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.



2. What are the different types of cloud models?

Public Cloud: Services are delivered over the internet and shared among multiple organizations (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).

Private Cloud: Services are used exclusively by one organization, often on-premises.

Hybrid Cloud: Combines both public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.



3. What are the key service models in cloud computing?

IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Virtualized computing resources (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure VMs).

PaaS (Platform as a Service): Development and deployment platforms (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Service).

SaaS (Software as a Service): Fully functional applications hosted by a provider (e.g., Google Workspace, Salesforce).



4. What is serverless computing?

Serverless computing allows developers to build and run applications without managing the underlying infrastructure. Cloud providers manage servers, scaling, and provisioning. Examples: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions.
