Basic Cloud Concepts

1. What is cloud computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics over the internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.



2. What are the different types of cloud models?

Public Cloud: Services are delivered over the internet and shared among multiple organizations (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).

Private Cloud: Services are used exclusively by one organization, often on-premises.

Hybrid Cloud: Combines both public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.



3. What are the key service models in cloud computing?

IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Virtualized computing resources (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure VMs).

PaaS (Platform as a Service): Development and deployment platforms (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Service).

SaaS (Software as a Service): Fully functional applications hosted by a provider (e.g., Google Workspace, Salesforce).



4. What is serverless computing?

Serverless computing allows developers to build and run applications without managing the underlying infrastructure. Cloud providers manage servers, scaling, and provisioning. Examples: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions.





---

Cloud Providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)

5. What is Amazon EC2?

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provides scalable virtual servers in the cloud. You can choose instances based on your performance and cost needs.



6. How does Amazon S3 differ from Amazon EBS?

Amazon S3: Object storage for storing and retrieving large amounts of unstructured data.

Amazon EBS: Block storage for use with Amazon EC2 instances.



7. What is Azure Resource Manager (ARM)?

ARM is Azure's deployment and management service. It allows you to manage resources (VMs, storage, etc.) through templates, APIs, and tools.



8. What is Google Cloud's Compute Engine?

Google Compute Engine is an IaaS service that provides scalable virtual machines to run workloads in GCP.





---

Networking

9. What is a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)?

A VPC is a logically isolated section of the cloud where you can launch resources in a virtual network that you define. Example: AWS VPC, Azure Virtual Network.



10. How do you secure a cloud network?

Use Security Groups and Network ACLs.

Encrypt data in transit and at rest.

Configure firewalls and VPNs.

Regularly monitor and audit network traffic.



11. What is a Load Balancer?

A Load Balancer distributes incoming application traffic across multiple servers to ensure availability and reliability.



12. What is DNS, and how does it work in the cloud?

DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names to IP addresses. Cloud providers offer managed DNS services (e.g., Route 53 in AWS, Azure DNS, Google Cloud DNS).





---

Storage

13. What is Object Storage, and where is it used?

Object Storage stores data as objects (data + metadata). It is ideal for unstructured data like images, videos, and backups. Examples: AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage.



14. What is the difference between scaling up and scaling out?

Scaling Up: Increasing the resources (e.g., RAM, CPU) of a single server.

Scaling Out: Adding more servers to distribute the load.



15. How do you back up data in the cloud?

Use managed backup services (e.g., AWS Backup, Azure Recovery Services).

Automate snapshot creation for instances and databases.





---

Security

16. What is IAM in cloud computing?

Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to securely control access to cloud resources by managing users, roles, and permissions.



17. How do you secure sensitive data in the cloud?

Encrypt data at rest and in transit.

Use strong IAM policies.

Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).

Regularly audit security settings.



18. What is a shared responsibility model in the cloud?

Cloud providers are responsible for the security of the cloud (hardware, software, networking), while customers are responsible for security in the cloud (data, applications, access control).





---

DevOps and Automation

19. What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

IaC is a method to manage and provision infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files, rather than physical hardware configuration. Examples: Terraform, AWS CloudFormation.



20. What is CI/CD in the cloud?

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment automates code integration, testing, and deployment pipelines. Cloud providers offer services like AWS CodePipeline, Azure DevOps, and Google Cloud Build.



21. How do you monitor cloud resources?

Use cloud-native monitoring tools:

AWS CloudWatch

Azure Monitor

Google Cloud Operations Suite


Set up alerts for key metrics and automate responses where possible.





---

Database and Analytics

22. What is a managed database service?

A fully managed database service eliminates administrative tasks such as hardware provisioning, patching, backups, and scaling. Examples: Amazon RDS, Azure SQL Database, Google Cloud SQL.



23. What is the difference between NoSQL and SQL databases?

SQL Databases: Relational databases using structured schemas (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

NoSQL Databases: Non-relational, schema-less databases for unstructured data (e.g., DynamoDB, MongoDB).



24. What is a Data Lake?

A Data Lake is a centralized repository for storing structured and unstructured data at scale. Example: AWS S3-based data lakes, Azure Data Lake Storage.





---

Problem-Solving

25. How would you migrate an on-premises application to the cloud?

Steps:

1. Assess the application and infrastructure.


2. Plan migration strategies (Lift-and-Shift, Re-architecting).


3. Choose the right cloud services.


4. Test in a staging environment.


5. Perform the migration and validate performance.





26. How would you troubleshoot high latency in a cloud-hosted application?

Check application logs for bottlenecks.

Monitor network latency using tools like CloudWatch or Azure Monitor.

Scale resources or use load balancing.

Optimize database queries and caching.



27. What are the steps to handle a cloud security breach?

Identify the scope of the breach.

Isolate affected resources.

Analyze logs and identify the root cause.

Patch vulnerabilities and restore from backups.

Implement improved security measures.
